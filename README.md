APIs Used
OpenWeatherMap
Google Map: Places API

## Concept
### For WeatherPy
I called on two different APIS to make a dataset that i could use to make meaningful decisions when picking vacation destinations based on my weather preferences.
I build a script to analize weather data across the world, however, you can change the latitudes and longitudes to narrow your choice of cities.
I generated a cities list and performed an API call to perform a weather check on each city.
I filtered the data and plotted it so i could visualize any weather correlations by latitude.

### For VacationPy
I created a new dataframe for vacationPy by adding my desirable weather parameters for what i consider to be ideal conditions for a vacation and amended the cities dataframe with those parameters.
I generated a heatmap of the results.
I then added hotels to that heatmap so i could see what my accomadation options were in those ideal cities.
Now i have a nice visualization of my perfect places to vacation!! Yay!!
